### Todo
- comment on Assets.odt in journal 
- talk about differences from whats going to to original implementation
- Illustrate a path generation technique

### Done
- Discussed one difference
- Posted a working path generator

### Discussion
- Original game had colored bariers. I want to change this to colored paths so
  that the procedural level generation is easier to program and checking for
  solvability is easier.
- Path generator does not produce actual mazes, is only meant to illustrate joining paths and storing them separately
